## Troubleshooting
* If you don't have QT libraries installed, you may get this error when installing Capybara
   * `Command 'qmake -spec macx-g++' not available`
      * Just run `brew install qt`. [Learn more](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit/wiki/Installing-Qt-and-compiling-capybara-webkit)
* If you get the following error when building the gem, you need to stage the deletion of
`preseason.gem` file by `git stage -u preseason.x.x.x.gem`
```
